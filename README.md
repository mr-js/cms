 Enterprise instant messaging system based on an open object-oriented database (web service prototype)

 ## Usage

 ## Examples
 ![GUI](/images/cms_1.png)
 Now enter a user name (e.g., "X") and a space name (e.g., "test") at the top and click Switch -- you will join the selected discussion space under the specified user. If you press Erase, current discussion space will be erased from all participants in the discussion.

 ## Remarks
 You can attach various types of attachments to your messages, and you can preview the most popular file types (documents, images, videos) directly in the message history. In this case, each message has a hash that is automatically recalculated when changed, including attachments. All prototype data is stored in the open json format.
